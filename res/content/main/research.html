<h3>[ Coming soon to a theater near you. ]</h3>
<p>Here's a little of my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SsWqcaKHSgFPztiEcrmhE0EpCseiNxIIAigREo-RE14/edit?usp=sharing">research proposal</a> to hold you over :)</p>
<p>
  I'm very excited about this work. The idea is to guide the software development and management process of SCRUM with 
  artificial intelligence. Currently, I am seeking out project groups within the (awesome) 
  <a href="https://orgsync.com/151579/chapter">WSU SaaS club</a> to test my model on.
